🌟# Mini Projects

A curated collection of small, focused mini-projects exploring Python, data analysis, machine learning concepts, automation, and quick technical experiments. These serve as foundational exercises that help me sharpen core skills while preparing for larger AI and Data Science projects.

🔧## Mini Tech Projects – Overview

This repository contains the kinds of small projects I build while learning or testing new ideas. They include Python scripts, analytics tasks, visualizations, ML basics, and automation experiments.
They are not full applications—but each one plays an important role in strengthening my fundamentals as a Data Science student.

📌## What These Projects Cover

Each folder in this repository contains a short, focused mini-project. Some include simple data cleaning tasks, some are visualization explorations, and others are quick machine-learning experiments.
You’ll also find Python automation scripts and SQL mini-assignments.

Instead of spreading tiny repos across GitHub, I’ve placed everything here in one organized space—making it easier to track my progress and keep my GitHub clean.

🎯## Purpose of This Repository

This repo exists to reflect my learning process.
These small projects help me:

Practice concepts quickly

Understand topics more deeply

Build confidence before working on large DS/AI applications

Experiment freely with new ideas

It’s an ongoing workspace where I grow step by step.

🚀## What’s Coming Next

More mini-projects will be added regularly, including:

Feature engineering practice

Tiny Streamlit dashboards

NLP preprocessing workflows

Time-series mini experiments

SQL analytics case studies

This repo will continue evolving as my skills grow.
