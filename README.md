# mini-projects
A collection of small, focused mini-projects exploring Python, data analysis, ML concepts, and automation. These experiments help me sharpen core skills while building toward larger AI and Data Science projects.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## **Mini Tech Projects** ##

This repository is a collection of my small, hands-on technical experiments. These are the kind of projects I build while learning, exploring new ideas, or testing out concepts in Python, data analysis, machine learning, and automation. They aren’t full-scale applications, but they play an important role in sharpening my fundamentals and helping me grow as a Data Science student.

## **What These Projects Are About** ##

Each folder in this repo contains a short, focused project. Some are simple data analysis tasks, some are small visualizations, and others are quick machine learning experiments. I’ve also included a few Python automation scripts and SQL mini-tasks. All of these are little building blocks that strengthen the skills I use in my larger projects.
Instead of scattering tiny repos all over GitHub, I’ve organized everything here in one clean place. It keeps my profile neat and makes it easy to track my learning progress.

## **Why This Repo Exists** ##

This collection is all about learning through doing. These small projects help me practice ideas quickly, understand concepts more deeply, and build confidence before working on larger Data Science or AI projects. It’s an ongoing space where I experiment, try new approaches, and improve step by step.

## **What’s Coming Next** ##

I’ll continue adding more mini-projects as I learn—
things like feature engineering demos, tiny dashboards, basic NLP workflows, and short time-series experiments. Think of it as a growing journal of my technical journey.

## **About Me** ##

I’m Karanbir Singh, a B.Tech CSE student and aspiring Data Scientist. I enjoy building projects, exploring datasets, and turning ideas into something practical. This repository is a small but meaningful part of that journey.
